storage:

    ## All default storage paths are relative to mra's root which is described here:

    root: "/my/full/path/to/mra/root"

    ## However, you can specify specific directories for any of those sub-directories.
    ## They will default to root/sub_directory_name
    # services: ""
    # available: ""
    # resources: ""

    ## Folowing the same principle, the folowing two directories will
    ## default to resources/sub_directory_name
    # fonts: ""
    # styles: ""
    # data: ""
